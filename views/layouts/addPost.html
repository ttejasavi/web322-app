             <p>
                 I am Tejasavi and I am a student at Seneca College. I am currently enrolled in Computer programming course. I found the course a bit tough in the beginning but with my professors' support I am able to adjust in this environment. My hobbies are playing badminton, cooking, singing and dancing. I really enjoy these activities in my free time. I am also interested in painting and sometimes I draw some pictures on my diary. Also, I am working as a part time employee in a Production factory and I am enjoying my job on weekends.
